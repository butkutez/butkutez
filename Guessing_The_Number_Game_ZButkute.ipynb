        "\"Guess the Number\" is a game created using the Python programming language, where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The player receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether their guess is too low or too high. The goal is to guess the number within 10 attempts. The game code makes use of functions, loops, conditionals, and input handling."
